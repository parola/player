Hello, in the CODE you can find the flash player code, that is working perfectly as a web app (www.livesets.si/player.php). Now we need your help to make an all platform web radio player like iPhone, Android Phones, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, iPad, Amazon Kindle, Android Tablets, Samsung Smart TV, Panasonic Viera TV, Roku Sonos, Logitech l UE.

Player's website is written in PHP, so it can read current track and the next five from the playlist file. We believe HTML5 was be the right answer to transform web to mobile website. But the issue was how to read and display a dynamic playlist just under the player in HTML5. Here is where we are stuck.



Then we did a poor mobile site where we iframe-ed the playlist from the server's site. here is what we did: http://livesets.si/m/

So to be able to broadcast FREE to various listeners we need your help with:

1.) html5 solution that includes reading from the dynamic playlist (current song)
2.) win/mac/mobile/tablet application.

Thx for all the help guys!!
Your support is very much appreciated :))
